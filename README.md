I am doing [Advent of Code 2022](http://adventofcode.com/2022).
(I also did [2021](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2021))

I am also learning [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

And I am again coding on Windows with [Sublime Text 4](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [GitSavvy](https://github.com/timbrel/GitSavvy).

# Learnings

* Oh boy Haskell is going to be a learning curve. Day 1 probably took me an hour to wrap my head around.
